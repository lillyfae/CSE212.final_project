    What is the purpose of the data structure?

    What is the performance of the data structure (you will need to talk about big O notation)?

    What kind of problems can be solved using the data structure?

    How would the data structure be used in Python (in some cases you will need to discuss recursion)?

    What kind of errors are common when using the data structure?

    A complete example of a problem solved using the data structure. The problem should be created by you and not be a copy of an existing problem.

    A second problem (again created by you) which is given to the student of your tutorial to solve on their own. You need to provide a link to the solution.

    Your tutorial must use the Python programming language.
